# Felis's dotfiles

* These are my dotfiles that I use on my laptop. They are forked from [Simon's Dotfiles](https://github.com/SimonSelg/dotfiles) and adjusted to my personal needs and preferences.
* This README is also largely Simon's README.

## Setup
#### installing & using

* fork this to your own acct
* clone that repo
* read and run parts of `setup-a-new-machine.sh`
* read and run `symlink-setup.sh`
  * git config needs attention, read the notes.
* use it. yay!

#### maintenance

* commit/push changes you want.
* you can also hypothetically cherry-pick commits from me and mathias and our fork ecosystem.

#### shell

This repo contains config for bash.

## my favorite parts.

### [`.aliases`](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases) and [`.functions`](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/master/.functions)

So many goodies.

### The "readline config" (`.inputrc`)
Basically it makes typing into the prompt amazing.

* tab like crazy for autocompletion that doesnt suck. tab all the things. srsly.
* no more <tab><tab> that says "Display all 1745 possibilities? (y or n)" YAY
* type `cat <uparrow>` to see your previous `cat`s and use them.
* case insensitivity.
* tab all the livelong day.



### Moving around in folders (`z`, `...`, `cdf`)
`z` helps you jump around to whatever folder. It uses actual real magic to determine where you should jump to. Seperately there's some `...` aliases to shorten `cd ../..` and `..`, `....` etc. Then, if you have a folder open in Finder, `cdf` will bring you to it.
```sh
z dotfiles
z blog
....      # drop back equivalent to cd ../../..
z public
cdf       # cd to whatever's up in Finder
```
`z` learns only once its installed so you'll have to cd around for a bit to get it taught.
Lastly, I use `open .` to open Finder from this path. (That's just available normally.)

### `.extra` for your private configuration

There will be items that don't belong to be committed to a git repo, because either 1) it shoudn't be the same across your machines or 2) it shouldn't be in a git repo. Kick it off like this:

`touch ~/.extra && $EDITOR $_`

I have some EXPORTS, my PATH construction, and a few aliases for ssh'ing into my servers in there.

I don't know how other folks manage their $PATH, but this is how I do mine:

```shell
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/sbin
PATH=$PATH:/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/.rvm/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/code/git-friendly
# ...

export PATH
```

### `~/bin`

One-off binaries that aren't via an npm global or homebrew. [git open](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open), [wifi-password](https://github.com/rauchg/wifi-password), [coloredlogcat](https://developer.sinnerschrader-mobile.com/colored-logcat-reloaded/507/), [git-overwritten](https://github.com/mislav/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/git-overwritten), and `subl` for Sublime Text.
